== Introduction

RHCSA Challenge Exercises

Purpose:
This repository of exercises supplements the existing Red Hat System Administration course material and is designed to further sharpen students' skills. Exercises will have an estimated time to complete that will vary from minutes to hours, but all will somehow relate to an objective of the Red Hat Certified System Administrator exam (RHCSA).

== How to Contribute

This is an open source project created through contributions from North America Red Hat Academy partners. If you would like to contribute, please reach out to Kelly Barley (kbarley@redhat.com) to learn more about the project and the guidelines for contributing.


== Prerequisites

Each exercise will have a different set of prerequisites depending on how advanced the challenge is. If a student has taken both Red Hat System Administration I and II, they should be equipped to attempt every exercise.
